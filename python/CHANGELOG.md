# Changelog

Versions here track the Python package, not the `bixverse-rs` crate. A wheel
reports the crate it vendored as `bixverse.__core_version__`.

## 0.1.0

First release.

- `CellReader` opens a bixverse binary sparse store and reports its shape,
  layout and normalisation target size.
- `CellLoader` iterates a cell-major store in minibatches. One feeder thread
  decompresses ahead of the consumer into a bounded queue, with the GIL
  released while it works. Each pass reshuffles and spawns its own feeder, so
  concurrent passes do not share state.
- Batches are sparse CSR by default. On a 20k x 20k store at 10% density the
  dense layout measured 53% slower per epoch, which is what settled the
  default.
- `Batch.scipy_csr()` rebuilds a batch as a `scipy.sparse.csr_matrix` over the
  same buffers.
- Errors from the crate surface as `BixverseError` and `SparseFileError`, with
  missing and unreadable files mapping to the built-in `OSError` hierarchy.
